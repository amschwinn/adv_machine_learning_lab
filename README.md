# Advance Machine Learning Lab

## Lab 1
### Kernel Methods
For this lab, we compared kernelized and non-kernilzed forms on the following algorithms on non-linearly seperable datasets:
	- PCA
	- Kmeans
	- Logisitic Regression

We compared these algorithms using the following benchmark datasets from scikit learn:
	-Half Moons
	-Center Circles
	-Swiss Rolls
	-Classification

For each of the listed algorithms and datasets, we compared our own implimentation against premade scikit-learn's implimentations.
We compared the quality of the results, such as the explained variance with PCA or the accuracy of logisitic regression, as well
as the run-time efficiency.

The forth part of lab, we impliment one class SVM and Maximum Enclosing Ball in MatLab.
